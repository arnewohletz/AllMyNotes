=========================================

This `reference sheet <../../_static/sql_alchemy_basics.pdf>`_ shows the basic
declaration of model classes (here to be used in a SQLite database):

    * Author
    * Book
    * Publisher
    * Book-Publisher (a book may be published at multiple publishers, a publisher may have many books)
    * Author-Publisher (an author may have multiple publishers, a publisher may have many authors)
