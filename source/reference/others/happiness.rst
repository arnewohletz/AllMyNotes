How to be happy - what Happiness scientists say :footcite:`mcmahon_happiness,ducharme_happiness,haupt_happiness`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are some loose notes on an article published in Time magazin issue from
the 7th of January 2023:

* Being happy all the time isn’t feasible - or even desirable - goal
* It’s being true to yourself and all emotion that come up

Requirements:

- a sense of control and autonomy over one’s life
- being guided by meaning and purpose
- connecting with other people

Statements:

* Happiness can be measured, strengthened and taught
* The more you notice how happy or how grateful you are, the more it grows
* Many reliable ways to increase happiness levels are free, like meditating and
  practicing compassion, gratitude and altruism

Practical ways:

* Acknowledge negative emotions, don’t suppress them. Deal with them appropriately.
* Spend time with family and friends outside of the house or a professional setting - at least once a week
* Pursue hobbies (art, music, cooking, reading) - five to six times a week
* Sufficient sleep - at least 7 hours a day
* Exercise in sports - three to six times weekly
* Go into the nature - at least three times a week
* Notice and savour positive events, mindful awareness, non judgement, gratitude and acts of kindness

If you catastrophize, you will likely suffer from bad events, and if you have an optimistic mindset,
you will likely be more resilient.

Breathing is an important source of energy -> **SKY breathing** (https://youtu.be/flL5orF1lYw):

    - **Alternate Nostril Breathing (ANB)**: Abwechseln mit linken/rechten Nasenloch aus
      und einatmen, anderes zugeben -> 25 x jede Seite
    - **Bellow Breath (BB)**: Arme beim Einatmen nach oben strecken, bei Ausatmen auf
      Schulterhöhe runterziehen (schnelle Atemzüge). 15 - 20 x Hoch+Runter, insgesamt 3 x,
      dazwischen je 15 Sekunden Pause
    - **Ocean Sound Breath (OSB)**: Halsmuskeln anspannen, etwas tieferes Ein - und Ausatmen.
      Ton klingt ähnlich wie Wellen am Strand. 3 - 10 Minuten

Lastly, a quote from Sojouner Truth:

    “Life is a hard battle anyway. If we laugh and sing a little as we fight the
    fight for freedom, it makes it all go easier. I will not allow my life’s light
    to be determined by the darkness around me.”
