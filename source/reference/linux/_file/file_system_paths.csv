Path,Description
**/**,"Root directory"
**/boot**,"System critical directory which contains files required for booting: kernel, boot manager and ramdisk `initramrd` with drivers"
**/boot/grub**,"System critical directory which contains config data for the grub boot manager; optional changes to ``rub.cfg`` only by advanced users"
**/bin**,"System critical directory which contains main executables, which are required for system operations (like bash, chmod, mount). Also see ``/sbin`` and ``/usr/sbin``"
**/cdrom**,"Former mount directory for optical drives (same as ``/floppy``)"
**/dev**,"System directory for device files: all recognized devices are displayed as files here"
**/etc**,"Central directory for all system-wide configuration data, partially directly in its root like sudo-rights, fstab, mime-types (file types),shadow (accounts and passwords), but most in extra directories like ``/etc/ssh`` (OpenSSH configuration), ``/etc/X11`` (GUI configurations), ``/etc/apt`` (list of all loaded package lists)"
**/home**,"Collective directory for all user accounts (except *root*)"
**/home/[user]**,"Home directory of a user which contains typical sub-directories for images or documents. Besides the temporary mount directories ``/media/[user]`` and ``/run/user/[account_id]`` it is the only directory where the user has all rights, including ownership"
**/home/[user]/.cache**,"User specific temporary storage, mostly for fonts, thumbnails or system icons"
**/home/[user]/.config**,"Important hidden collective directory for user specific software settings (desktop, language, auto-launch, webbrowser, email, mime-types and others)"
**/home/[user]/.local**,"Collective directory for desktop user settings, which are prioritized over common settings, like desktop links (``.desktop`` files) at ``~/.local/share/applications``"
**/lost+found**,"Contains rescued file fragments from a file system analysis via `fsck` (usually only used by forensic scientist)"
**/media**,"Mount directory for removable media like USB or DVD devices. Commonly used by automount when inserting the device. The content is loaded under ``/media/[user]/[device]`` with all access rights for the current user"
**/mnt**,"Optional directory for temporary and static mount of external devices like USB or DVD (is not used by automount, which uses ``/mnt``)"
"| **/lib**
| **/lib64**","System critical directories contains essential libraries (32 and 64 Bit). Additional lib-directories (like ``/usr/lib``, ``/var/lib``) are required for applications, but are not system-critical"
**/opt**,"Optional collective directory for additionally installed applications, which are not part of the Linux distribution"
"| **/proc**
| **/sys**","Collective directory for dynamically requested system and hardware data of all kind, especially CPU, RAM, kernel, devices and processes. ``/proc`` provides information to many system tools, like CPU and RAM queries (for example `cpuinfo`, `meminfo`, `modules`, `mounts`, `partitions`, `uptime`)"
**/tmp**,"Collective directory for temporarily needed files by software executions or installations. It's the only directory in which all system accounts have unlimited writing access"
**/root**,"Home directory for the pseudo-account root; if root is actively used, the same sub-directories for account data and configuration files like in ``/home/[user]`` are created"
**/run**,"Dynamic information shelf for all applications (tmp-directory during runtime)"
**/run/[user]/[user-id]/gvfs/**,"Mount directory for automatically hooked network resources for Gnome-like desktops (Gnome, Budgie, Cinnamon, XFCE)"
**/usr**,"Collective directory for non-system related applications (User System Resources), so most application used on the desktop"
**/usr/bin**,"Contains most applications featuring a graphical user interface (as opposed to ``/bin`` and ``/sbin``)"
**/usr/lib**,"Contains libraries required by non-system related applications"
**/usr/local**,"Complementary software directory; executable programs under ``/usr/local/bin`` are prioritized over ``/usr/bin``"
**/usr/share/applications**,"Collective directory for program launcher, which are shown in menus and the desktop"
**/sbin**,"System critical directory which contain main executables for system maintenance, which can only be executed with root rights (for example `fdisk`, `fsck`, `hdparm`, `mkfs`, `parted`). Also see ``/bin`` and ``/usr/bin``"
**/srv**,"The default mount point for devices on server systems compliant with FSH (File System Hierarchy), although some servers still use ``/mount`` or ``/media``"
**/var/log**,"Collective directory for system logs"
**/var/spool**,"Directory for pending queue jobs, foremost print orders"
**/var/www/html**,"Default directory for Apache and nginx web services"
