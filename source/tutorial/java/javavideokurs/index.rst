JavaVideoKurs
=============
The JavaVideoKurs is a video-based tutorial for Java Beginners.

The videos are published at http://www.javavideokurs.de/ where you must create
an account and purchase the JavaVideoKurs first.

Not every chapter of the course is covered in these notes, as some are so simple,
that no future reference is required.

My personal code written during this tutorial is located at
